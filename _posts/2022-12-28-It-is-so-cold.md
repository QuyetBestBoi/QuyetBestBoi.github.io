Before starting my little post, I have prepared a small quiz for you kids.  
To deal with the freezing winter, everybody need:  
<input type="text" id="quiz" name="quiz"/>  

<span style="color:green" id="correct">That is correct!  </span>  

<span style="color:red" id="incorrect">
  Nooo! That is totally wrong!  
  What you really need is Quyet!  
</span>  

<span id="more-info">
  Quyet is super chubby and fluffy, meaning his body can maintain heat for a very long time.  
  Therefore, just by staying close to him (or even hugging him), you can easily survive this deadly winter!
